a. I honestly don't know much about coding. But I wish to learn something or everything from amFOSS. There won't e a reaso you will choose me by my programming or coding skills but I'll work hard to be the best if you choose me.
b. I don't even know the basics of coding ad i wish to be better or the best in the next 6 monyhs.
c. I'll be there for help anytime if that is something i know about.
There are many students out there,including me, who don't know about these coding and all who wish to join the FOSS club. So it'd be good if the selection process is accordingly..
